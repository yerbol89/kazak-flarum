Now that the extension is uploaded to your server, you will have to install it. Log-in to your forum and click on your username at the top right of the screen. You will see a pop-up, and you have to click on the *Administration* link. Once in the administration page, you will have to click on *Extensions*. Then, once in the extensions page, you will see the grey tinted *Russian* extension, with an icon of the Earth and a blue background. Hover the extension and you will see a dotted vertical menu. Click on the vertical menu and click on *Enable*.

Your Russian extension is now installed. Congratulations! You and your users can select the language via a dropdown menu located in the header, at the right of the search box.
